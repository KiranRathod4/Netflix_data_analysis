# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The goal is to understand key characteristics of the content library, including genres and the trend of content added over the years.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is `netflix1.csv`.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   Google Colab
*   Git

## Analysis Steps

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: Loaded the dataset and performed initial checks for missing values and duplicates.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Converted date formats, dropped irrelevant columns, and processed the 'listed_in' column to analyze genres.
3.  **Value Counts**: Examined the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows).
4.  **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to explore genre frequency and the trend of content added over time.

## Findings and Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

*   "International Movies" is the most frequent genre on Netflix.
*   The number of movies and TV shows added to the platform has significantly increased over the years, with a peak observed around 2019-2021.

## How to Run the Notebook

To run this analysis yourself, you can open the `Netflix_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab. The notebook contains all the code used for data loading, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
